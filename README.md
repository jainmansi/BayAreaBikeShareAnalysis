# Introduction

In this project, I am analyzing SF Bay Area Bike Share dataset. To do so, I am using following datasets:

1. Trips Dataset
2. Station Dataset
3. Weather Dataset
4. Yelp Customer Reviews Dataset

Through this analysis, I aim to achieve a better understanding of how different factors affect the bike sharing and how BABS has been performing over the course of time.

Note: All the charts are plotted using Tableau

## Analysis 1 -- Binning pattern to determine distribution of rides in a day

Using this analysis, I aimed at finding the spread of rides over the hours of the day.

## Analysis 3 -- Distribution of rides over months

## Analysis 4 -- Determining Top 10 stations based on the number of rides

## Analysis 5 -- Distribution of rides based on temperature

## Analysis 6 -- Sentiment Analysis of user's yelp reviews
